  title: A (north) Boulder Christmas
  greeting: >
    The world is hazy and swims before you as you open your eyes. You wake up
    with a splitting headache and can't seem to remember very much. Something
    seems to be nagging at the back of your mind, but you aren't quite sure
    what it is.
  unknown_action: You aren't so sure about that.

          You are in a modest (and perhaps too small) town house, which is in 
          a rather chaotic state as the inhabitants prepare for Christmas. 
          The floor is strewn with Amazon delivery boxes and wrapping paper. 
          On the wall is an advent calendar with an alarming amount of doors 
          already open.

          The front door is to the west, and the stairs going up to the second 
          floor is to the east. To the northeast are the basement stairs, going 
          down.

          You emerge into a snowy mountain landscape. There is about a foot
          of snow on the ground, and you can see large mountain peaks far
          in the distance to the west. To the east is a modest town house.
          To the south is Norwood Avenue. To the west is Broadway street, and
          the mountains beyond.

          The second floor features three rooms, a master suite (and you can't
          help but notice a totally killer bath towel warmer on the bathroom 
          wall ... whoever owns this place truly is living life to the 
          fullest!), a child's room and a small office. 
          The downstairs is to the west.

          You head upstairs.

          You are in the basement. There's a small playroom as well as an office

          to the main floor.

          A busy street with cars traveling north and south at a frenzied pace.
          A south-bound bus has just pulled up to the stop nearest you. A 
          cross walk leads west into the hills. To the east is the front yard
          of the townhouse.

          A tree lined street sloapes east away from the front range. There 
          aren't many leaves left on the trees, and the few that are left, 
          seem like one strong gust might blow them all off.
          To the north is the front yard of the town house, and further to the
          south is a street sign that reads 'Wilson Ct.'

          You cross Broadway and head up towards the mountains. Appearing before
          you is the Wonderland Lake. "Aptly named", you think to 
          yourself. There is a running trail that loops the lake, as well as a 
          playground to the north. Back to the east is Broadway street.

          On Wilson court is a charming cul-de-sac. Houses line the street, and
          in the distance you can see the famous flat iron mountains. Behind
          you to the north is Norwood street.

          The iconic brick lined Pearl Street. Many shoppers are finishing up
          their last minute gift shopping, and it seems like the snow may fall
          at any minute.
        travel_failure: >
          The driver of the bus looks at you expecting a ticket. After an
          embarassing moment, you get off the bus, as the driver sighs audibly.

          You scan your bus pass, and take a seat for the ride.

          You lunge for the dog and miss. You are probably going to need 
          something to keep a hold on this wild beast or it will just run off 
          again as soon as you set it down.
        take_action: >
          You hold out your hand long enough for the dog to curiously wander up
          to you. Acting quickly, you slip the leash onto the collar.

          [the rest of the letter is smudged and illegible.]

          Thinking quickly before the tears come, you offer the young boy the
          toy truck, and after a moment of digging he seems willing to come 
          with you. "I'm a bulldozer!" he says.

          It's a well-loved yellow construction truck. This one has dug a lot

          As you arrive on Pearl street to the setting sun,
          the Christmas lights lining the street turn on as the sun is setting.
          Your one true love sneaks up behind you with a kiss on the cheek.
          You spend some time walking down the street gazing into shop windows,
          surrounded by your family. The world is busy and swirls around you,
          and now you've have everything that you need.
