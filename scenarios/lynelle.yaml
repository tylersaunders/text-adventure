          You are in a dimly lit cabin, a fierce  wind howls outside and
          rattles the windows. On a small side table near the corner is
          a lamp. To the north is a wooden door. To the east is another door.

          You emerge into a snowy mountain landscape. There is about a foot

          in the distance to the east and west.
